      <h2>Why?</h2>
      <p>Do you find rating and ranking movies boring? Well, you aren't alone. It's often difficult to truly rate movies by giving them a fixed score, and - at least in my opinion - its often even harder to decide which movies should be at the top, and which ones should be at the bottom. AutoRank solves this problem </p>
    </div>

    <div>
      <h2>How?</h2>
      <p>Despite its name, AutoRank isn't really... auto. It's more of a fun game that sets two movies up against each other. All you do is decide which one you think is better based on a given common factor. Over time, AutoRank can accurately rank these movies for you using an ELO algorithm.</p>
